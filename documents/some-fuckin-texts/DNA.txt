DNA - 03:47
- Open the CSV file and DNA sequence, read contents into memory.
- For each STR, compute the longest run of consecutive repeats in the DNA sequence.
- Compare the STR counts againts each row in the CSV file.
OPENING THE FILES - 04:20
- First row of CSV file has name as the first column and STRs for each of the remanining columns.
- Each remaining row corresponds to a person.
HINTS - 05:08
- Python's CSV module has reader and DictReader,
- Python's SYS module gives you access to sys.argv for command-line arguments.
- Once opened a text file f using open(filename), read its content using f.read().
COMPUTING STR COUNTS - 06:28
- For each position in the sequence: compute how many times the STR repeats starting at that position.
- For each position, keep checking successive substrings until the STR repeats no longer.
HINTS - 07:00
- len(s) gets the length of the string s
- s[i:j] takes the string s and return the substring with all characters from the ith character up to (but no including) the jth.
